# Consumer acknowledgement timeout (in milliseconds)
# Default is 1800000 (30 minutes) in RabbitMQ 3.12+
# Set to 4 hours to support long-running Celery tasks with safety margin
# Tasks with time_limit >= 3 hours should also set acks_late=False
# Set to 0 to disable (not recommended for production)
# See: https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/consumers#acknowledgement-timeout
